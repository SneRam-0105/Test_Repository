# Test_Repository

## I am creating this repo to test few git commands and to understand flow of it between local and online repo

#### Steps to follow

1. I will first create a online repo
2. Then create a local repo by cloning the online repo
3. Add a readme file with the instructions of what I am doing
4. **Make changes in local repository and try to push it**
5. Make changes in remote repository
6. `Understanding the Merge conflict`
7. Solve the merge conflict

### This step is to make changes in local repo and pushing to create merge conflict
